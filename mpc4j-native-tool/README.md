# `mpc4j-native-tool`

## Introduction

`mpc4j` leverages native C/C++ codes to speed up cryptographic operations. The native codes and Java codes are interacted by the [Java Native Interface (JNI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/) technique. We separate native C/C++ codes into two modules, namely `mpc4j-native-cool` and `mpc4j-native-fhe`. `mpc4j-native-tool` contains native codes for basic cryptographic operations, while `mpc4j-native-fhe` contains native codes for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using [SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL). All basic cryptographic operations in `mpc4j-native-tool` have alternative pure-Java implementations in `mpc4j` with the same functionalities and the same data representations.

`mpc4j-native-tool` relies on the following C/C++ libraries:

- [GMP](https://gmplib.org/): An efficient library for operations with arbitrary precision integers, rationals, and floating-point numbers.
- [NTL](https://libntl.org/): A high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures and algorithms for manipulating signed, arbitrary length integers and for vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over finite fields, developed by [Victor Shoup](https://shoup.net/). Note that one can further introduce [GF2X](https://gitlab.inria.fr/gf2x/gf2x) for more efficient operations in a Galois Field. However, since the installation procedure for [GF2X](https://gitlab.inria.fr/gf2x/gf2x) is rather complicated, we use NTL by default.
- [MCL](https://github.com/herumi/mcl): A portable and fast pairing-based cryptography library. MCL also includes fast Elliptic Curve implementations. 
- [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/): A modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more. libsodium includes efficient X25519 and Ed25519 implementations. 

Installing `mpc4j-native-tool` might be a bit complicated for ones who are not that familiar with Unix-like systems. As the procedures differ across platforms, here we provide installation instructions for macOS (x86_64), macOS (M1), Ubuntu, and CentOS, respectively.

We recommend creating a new dictionary (such as `~/lib`) to temporarily store all source codes and libraries before you start to install `mpc4j-native-tool`. All installation procedures assume you are under the dictionary `~/lib`.

**NOTE:** The following instructions are tested with the specified versions of the underlying libraries. Feel free to contact us if they do not work with newer versions.

## Install on MAC (x86_64)

### Necessary Tools

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installs [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) that Apple didn’t. Homebrew can be seen as `apt-get` or `yum` on macOS. Some libraries in `mpc4j-native-tool` can be installed directly using `homebrew`. You can easily install `homebrew` by following the instructions shown on the official site.

You need to install `openssl` and `cmake` for further installations by running the following command.

```shell
brew install openssl
brew install cmake
```

### GMP

GMP can be directly installed via `homebrew`: 

```shell
brew install gmp
```

GMP can also be installed via the source code. In this way, you can add `CFLAGS="-march=native -O3"` to obtain a more efficient GMP. 

Download GMP 6.2.1
```shell
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
```

Install GMP.

```shell
xz -d gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
tar -xvf gmp-6.2.1.tar
cd gmp-6.2.1
./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -O3" CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O3"
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

 ### NTL

Download `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install NTL on the default path.

```shell
cd ntl-11.5.1
cd src
./configure SHARED=on CXXFLAGS=-O3 # Must compile NTL as a shared library
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the ntl-11.5.1 path
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### MCL

Download [MCL v1.61](https://github.com/herumi/mcl/releases/tag/v1.61).

```shell
git clone -b v1.61 https://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
```

Compile and install MCL.

```shell
cd mcl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the build path
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### libsodium

You need to install libsodium via `homebrew`: 

```shell
brew install libsodium
```

### JAVA and JAVA_HOME

First, check if you have installed Java by the following command:

```
java --version
```

If you cannot see the version information, then you may need to install Java on your own. We recommend installing Java from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Recall that if you just want to run `mpc4j`, higher Java versions are OK. However, if you want to develop `mpc4j`, you may need to install JDK8.

By default, Java will be installed under the path like `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-XX.X.X.jdk/Contents/Home` or `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/JDK_NAME/Comtents/Home`. After you find the Java installation path, run the following command to open `bash_profile`.

```shell
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

Then, add the following scripts in `bash_profile`. If you are not familiar with `vim`, just type `i` and use it just like a notebook. When you finish editing, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to confirm the modification.

```
export JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_PATH
```

Then, run the following command.

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can verify the result by running the following command and see if the Java installation path can be correctly shown.

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

**NOTE:** If your terminal is `zsh` instead of `bash`, you should replace `.bash_profile` with `.zshrc` in above commands.

### Compile `mpc4j-native-tool`

Go to the path of `mpc4j-native-tool`, run the following command to compile `mpc4j-native-tool`.

```shell
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
make
```

## Install Dependencies on MAC (M1)

### Necessary Tools

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installs [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) that Apple didn’t. Homebrew can be seen as `apt-get` or `yum` on macOS. Some libraries in `mpc4j-native-tool` can be installed directly using `homebrew`. You can easily install `homebrew` by following the instructions shown on the official site.

You need to install `openssl` and `cmake` for further installations by running the following command.

```shell
brew install openssl
brew install cmake
```

### GMP

Please **DO NOT** install GMP via `homebrew`. This is because MCL relies on GMP under aarch64. Instead, install GMP in C++ with versions higher than 6.2.1.

Download the source code of GMP 6.2.1.

```shell
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
```

Install the C++ version of GMP.

```shell
xz -d gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
tar -xvf gmp-6.2.1.tar
cd gmp-6.2.1
./configure --enable-cxx CFLAGS="-O3" CXXFLAGS="-O3"
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### NTL

Download `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install NTL on the default path.

```shell
cd ntl-11.5.1
cd src
./configure SHARED=on CXXFLAGS=-O3 # Must compile NTL as a shared library
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the ntl-11.5.1 path
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### MCL

Download the source code of  [MCL v1.61](https://github.com/herumi/mcl/releases/tag/v1.61). 

```shell
git clone -b v1.61 https://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
```

MCL currently does not have specific assembly optimizations for aarch64 platforms. Therefore, we need to remove assembly language support when compiling MCL. Compile and install MCL as follows.

```shell
cd mcl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DMCL_USE_ASM=OFF # remove assembly language support
make
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the build path
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### libsodium

You need to install libsodium via `homebrew`: 

```shell
brew install libsodium
```

### JAVA and JAVA_HOME

First, check if you have installed Java by the following command:

```
java --version
```

If you cannot see the version information, then you may need to install Java on your own. We recommend installing Java from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). 

By default, Java will be installed under the path like `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-XX.X.X.jdk/Contents/Home` or `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/JDK_NAME/Comtents/Home`. After you find the Java installation path, run the following command to open `bash_profile`.

```shell
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

Then, add the following scripts in `bash_profile`. If you are not familiar with `vim`, just type `i` and use it just like a notebook. When you finish editing, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to confirm the modification.

```
export JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_PATH
```

Then, run the following command.

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can verify the result by running the following command and see if the Java installation path can be correctly shown.

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

**NOTE:** If your terminal is `zsh` instead of `bash`, you should replace `.bash_profile` with `.zshrc` in above commands.


### Compile `mpc4j-native-tool`

Go to the path of `mpc4j-native-tool`, run the following command to compile `mpc4j-native-tool`.

```shell
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
make
```

## Install Dependencies on Ubuntu

The following guidelines have been tested both on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 with Docker image.

### Necessary Tools

Install `gcc`, `m4`, `make`, `cmake`, `g++`, `openssl` (and its development tool), `wget`, `xz-util`, and `vim` by the following command.

```shell
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install m4
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install openssl
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt install wget
sudo apt install xz-utils
sudo apt install vim
```

Also, we need to add the default path `/usr/local/lib` to be the additional library path. Run the following command to open the configuration file for `ldconfig`.

```shell
sudo vim /etc/ld.so.conf
```

Then, add the following scripts in the end of `ld.so.conf`. If you are not familiar with `vim`, just type `i` and use it just like a notebook. When you finish editing, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to confirm the modification.

```text
/usr/local/lib
```

Then, run the following command.

```shell
/sbin/ldconfig
```

### GMP

Note that different Ubuntu platforms needs different GMP version for compiling NTL. For example, our Ubuntu platform only supports [GMP v6.2.0](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.0.tar.xz). However, when using Ubuntu Docker image, [GMP v6.2.1](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz) is needed. When you compile NTL and you meet problems like:

```text
GMP version check (6.2.0/6.2.1)
```

you need to uninstall the inconsistent GMP version (by executing `make uninstall`) in the gmp source code dictionary, and compile and install the correct GMP version. In the following, we write `gmp-6.2.X` to represent different GMP version. Please replace `X` to the correct version number when executing the commands.

Run the following command to download the source code of GMP.

```shell
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.X.tar.xz
```

Install GMP.

```shell
xz -d gmp-6.2.X.tar.xz
tar -xvf gmp-6.2.X.tar
cd gmp-6.2.X
./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -O3" CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O3"
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

Install the development library for GMP.

```shell
sudo apt install libgmp-dev
```

 ### NTL

Download  `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install NTL on the default path.

```shell
cd ntl-11.5.1
cd src
./configure SHARED=on CXXFLAGS=-O3 # Must compile NTL as a shared library
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to ntl-11.5.1
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### MCL

Download the source code of [MCL v1.61](https://github.com/herumi/mcl/releases/tag/v1.61). 

```shell
git clone -b v1.61 https://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
```

Compile and install MCL.

```shell
cd mcl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the build path
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### libsodium

Download the latest version of libsodium. Currently, the latest version is [1.0.18](https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz).

```shell
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install Libsodium on the default path.

```shell
cd libsodium-1.0.18
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### JAVA and JAVA_HOME

First, check if you have installed Java by the following command:

```
java --version
```

If you cannot see the version information, then you may need to install Java on your own. We recommend installing Java from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). You can also simply install Java via the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

On Ubuntu, Java would be installed under the path like `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-XX.X.X`. You can find the Java installation path by the following command.

```shell
which java
```

After you find the Java installation path, run the following command to open `bashrc`.

```shell
vim ~/.bashrc
```

Then, add the following scripts in `bashrc`. If you are not familiar with `vim`, just type `i` and use it just like a notebook. When you finish editing, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to confirm the modification.

```
export JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_PATH
```

Then, run the following command.

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

You can verify the result by running the following command and see if the Java installation path can be correctly shown.

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

### Compile `mpc4j-native-tool`

Go to the path of `mpc4j-native-tool`, run the following command to compile `mpc4j-native-tool`.

```shell
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc # assign gcc
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++ # assign g++
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
make
```



## Install Dependencies on CentOS

The installation procedures on CentOS are almost identical with Ubuntu, except that CentOS uses `yum` instead of `apt` for library management.

### Necessary Tools

Install `gcc`, `m4`, `make`, `g++`, `openssl` by the following command.

```shell
sudo yum install gcc
sudo yum install m4
sudo yum install make
sudo yum install gcc-c++ # different from Ubuntu
sudo yum install openssl
sudo yum install openssl-devel # additional installation compared with Ubuntu
```

Note that we cannot directly install `cmake` via `yum`. Instead, we need to install `cmake` from source code by running the following command.

```shell
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.24.0/cmake-3.24.0.tar.gz # download a newer version. Currently the newer version is 3.24.0
tar -zxvf cmake-3.24.0.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.24.0
./bootstrap
make
make install
\cp -f ./bin/cmake ./bin/cpack ./bin/ctest /bin
cd .. # return to the original path
```

CentOS needs to install related libraries to support AES-NI by running the following commands (See [Cannot compile from source on Centos7](https://discuss.zerotier.com/t/cannot-compile-from-source-on-centos7/842) for more details).

```shell 
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install devtoolset-8
```

### GMP

As far as we know, Centos comes with its own GMP library. CentOS7 contains [GMP v6.0.0](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.0.0.tar.xz), and CentOS8, it contains [GMP v6.1.2](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz). Therefore, we need to install the same version of GMP in the corresponding version of Centos.Or we can download the latest version of GMP and replace the GMP that comes with Centos.

Run the following command to download the source code for version 6.x.x.

```shell
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.x.x.tar.xz
```

Run the following command to install GMP.

```shell
xz -d gmp-6.x.x.tar.xz
tar -xvf gmp-6.x.x.tar
cd gmp-6.x.x
./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -O3" CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O3"
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

You can replace the GMP of Centos through the following command.

```shell
cp /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so /usr/lib64/ #The first path in this command is the installation path of gmp
cp /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so.10 /usr/lib64/
cp /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so.10.4.1 /usr/lib64/
```

You may also need to install the development library for GMP by running the following command.

```shell
sudo yum install gmp-devel # different from Ubuntu
```

 ### NTL

Download `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install NTL on the default path.

```shell
cd ntl-11.5.1
cd src
./configure SHARED=on CXXFLAGS=-O3 # Must compile NTL as a shared library
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to ntl-11.5.1
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### MCL

Download the source code of [MCL v1.61](https://github.com/herumi/mcl/releases/tag/v1.61). 

```shell

```shell
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
```

Extract source codes from `libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz`.

```shell
tar -xvzf libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
```

Compile, check, and install Libsodium on the default path.

```shell
cd libsodium-1.0.18
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
cd .. # return to the original path
```

### JAVA and JAVA_HOME

You can directly install Java by the following command.

```shell
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64 # install JDK 8
```

You can find the Java installation path by the following command.

```shell
which java                      # It may show /usr/bin/java
ls -lrt /usr/bin/java           # It may show /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java
ls -lrt /etc/alternatives/java  # It may show /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.302.b08-0.el7_9.x86_64/jre/bin/java
```

After you find the Java installation path, run the following command to open `bash_profile`.

```shell
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

Then, add the following scripts in `bash_profile`. If you are not familiar with `vim`, just type `i` and use it just like a notebook. When you finish editing, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to confirm the modification.

```
export JAVA_HOME=YOUR_JAVA_PATH
```

Then, run the following command.

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can verify the result by running the following command and see if the Java installation path can be correctly shown.

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

### Compile `mpc4j-native-tool`

Go to the path of `mpc4j-native-tool`, run the following command to compile `mpc4j-native-tool`.

```shell
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
make
```

## Helpful Commands

If `cmake` reports some libraries are not found, you can run the following command to see which library has problem.

```shell
cmake .. -LA . # there is a dot
```
