# Implementations of Existing Works

`mpc4j` contains some implementations of existing works. Parts of the works are listed in this documentation. We note that we rewrite some of the implementations to have a unified style. See Section References in `README.md` for more details.

## Basic Tools

### Filter

Besides Bloom Filter, we implement some filter algorithms in `mpc4j-common-tool`, including Cuckoo Filter and Vacuum Filter. We plan to implement Morton Filter but without any timeline.

### Cuckoo Hash

We implement some Cuckoo Hashes in `mpc4j-common-tool`. See the following papers for more details.

### Cryptographic Tools

We implement some cryptographic tools in `mpc4j-common-tool`. We believe these tools may help users to implement other applications as well.

**Elligator Encoding for Curve25519**: An important tool for constructing simple maliciously secure PSI, see:

- Rosulek, Mike, and Ni Trieu. Compact and Malicious Private Set Intersection for Small Sets. CCS 2021, ACM, pp. 1166-1181.

**FourQ**: A high-security, high-performance elliptic curve that targets the 128-bit security level. Based on the open-source library [FourQlib](https://github.com/microsoft/FourQlib), we rewrite `MakeFile` so that now FourQ can run on MacBook.

## Oblivious Key-Value Storage

Oblivious Key-Value Storage (OKVS) is a very implement data structure abstraction used in MPC. We implement some OKVS data structures, including its instances like XePaXoS, PaXoS, and Mega Bin, in `mpc4j-common-tool`.

## Pseudorandom Correlation Generator

PCG allows two or more parties to securely generate long sources of useful correlated randomness via a local expansion of correlated short seeds. Correlated Oblivious Transfer (COT), Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE), Subfield VOLE, and multiplication triples can be seen as instances of PCG. We implement some PCG in `mpc4j-s2pc-pcg`.

### Basic Tools

We implement some basic tools used in PCG. We learned a lot from [KyberJCE](https://github.com/fisherstevenk/kyberJCE) when implementing Kyber. We learned a lot from [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit) when implementing Correlated Robust Hash Function (CRHF) and Twisted CRHF (TCRHF).

### Coin-tossing Protocol

Some protocols (especially protocol with malicious security) needs to invoke a (maliciously secure) coin tossing protocol for unbiased randomness generation. We implement the commonly used coin-tossing protocol that was proposed by Blum in the following paper.

- Blum, Manuel. Coin flipping by phone. In COMPCON, pp. 133-137. 1982.

The security proof is shown in the following paper.

### OT Extension and Silent OT

We implement some OT Extension (OTE) and Silent OT protocols. Note that currently, we have not updated our maliciously secure implementations based on "SoftSpokenOT: Communication – Computation Tradeoffs in OT Extension (CRYPTO 2022)", which introduce malicious security flaw in some of the existing protocols.

## Private Information Retrieval

We implement some Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols. We note that there are parameter adjustments and re-implementations for some of the protocols so that the results can run in a more robust manner. All protocols are implemented based on [SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) (instead of [NFLlib](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib)).

### Index PIR

We re-implement FastPIR, OnionPIR, SealPIR, and XPIR in `mpc4j-s2pc-pir`. We note that we learned a lot from their original implementations. See [FastPIR](https://github.com/ishtiyaque/FastPIR), [Onion-PIR](https://github.com/mhmughees/Onion-PIR), [SealPIR](https://github.com/microsoft/SealPIR) and [XPIR](https://github.com/XPIR-team/XPIR) for more details.

### Keyword PIR and Unbalanced PSI

We implement Keyword PIR (also known as Labeled PSI) in `mpc4j-s2pc-pir` and unbalanced PSI in `mpc4j-s2pc-pso`. Here we list other labeled PSI papers, e.g., schemes proposed in CCS 2018 and CCS 2017. We do not implement them since the scheme in CCS 2021 is strictly more efficient than others. We note that we learned a lot from their original implementations. See [APSI](https://github.com/microsoft/APSI) and [6857-private-categorization](https://github.com/aleksejspopovs/6857-private-categorization) for more details.
